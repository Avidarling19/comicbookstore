## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing comic book data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing API endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB on your machine or use a cloud service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comicbookstore.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd comicbookstore
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine. If using a cloud service, make sure to update your connection string in the code.

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. You should see a message indicating that the server is running on a specified port (default is 3000).
